Overview of concepts

What is a trauma-informed approach to user research? 
Trauma-informed research… 
Realizes the widespread impact of trauma 
Recognizes and acknowledges the signs and symptoms of trauma in participants, researchers and others involved with the research process 
Integrates knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices 
Seeks to actively resist retraumatization. (Adapted from SAMHSA)

What causes trauma? 
Trauma results from an event, series of events, or a set of circumstances that an individual experiences as physically or emotionally harmful or threatening. Traumatic events can be a single incident or a long-term chronic pattern. They can be experienced individually or collectively. 

Examples of traumatic events include, but are not limited to:
Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse
Living with a family member with physical or mental health conditions or substance use disorders
Domestic violence or sexual assault
Chronic poverty, racism, discrimination, or oppression
Violence in the community, war, or terrorism
Living through a natural disaster or other period of distress


SAMHSA’s foundation of a trauma-informed approach
“Really, the key is understanding the trauma-informed principles because then you can think of how to apply them in your particular situation.” - Melissa Eggleston

Six Key Principles Of a Trauma-Informed Approach: 
Safety 
Trustworthiness and Transparency 
Peer Support 
Collaboration and Mutuality 
Empowerment, Voice and Choice 
Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues

Using SAMHSA's 6 key principles can help researchers integrate trauma-informed practices into their research.

Caring for researchers
SAFETY
Who are we interviewing? 
Will participants feel safe during the interview?
Are there practices in place to support someone who might feel unsafe during an interview? 
Will researchers feel safe (not traumatized) by the intended research topics? 
Are there practices in place to support researchers who need to process before, during, or after an interview? 
Will researchers feel overwhelmed balancing interviews and other work? How can we support them? 
TRUSTWORTHINESS & TRANSPARENCY 


Is important information communicated clearly?
Can we be more transparent about the research process? 
How can we make consent easier to understand? 
Are expectations (deliverables, timelines) clearly communicated? 
COLLABORATION & MUTUALITY


Are we challenging the assumption of “the designer/researcher as the expert”?
Do we have a plan on how to support survivors if they get activated during a collaborative process? Are we prepared to stop the process if needed?
How can we be more relational and less extractive? 
Are we paying the people who provide insight?


EMPOWERMENT, VOICE, & CHOICE


Whenever possible, is personal information requested in a way that provides choices? 
Right to choose how much they disclose? 
Is the research elevating voices of real people impacted by the behavioral health system? 
Are researchers empowered? Are there ways to empower them more? 
CULTURAL, HISTORICAL, and GENDER ISSUES


Are we actively seeking for the perspective of people with under-represented or marginalized identities? Are we asking who’s missing?
Is this research using inclusive language?
What are the biases or assumptions we hold? Can we challenge my biases or assumptions? 
What are the biases/assumptions that BHA leaders hold about individuals and/or research? Can they challenge those biases or assumptions? 
PEER SUPPORT
n/a
How can researchers feel supported? In what ways do they want to feel supported by the broader team or peer researchers? 






Tactical tips for researchers 
(Source: Helping survivors to feel safe during UX research

Recruitment and participant communication

Recommendations
Note and/or Example(s)
✅ Consider who is or isn’t represented in your participant group
Example: Geographic diversity can be a really important element of diversity to include Colorado-based user research. Are you speaking to anyone outside of the “Front Range” (i.e. Denver-area, Boulder, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs?). 

Example: If you are researching with providers, how large / tech resourced is the org? Are you speaking with any other smaller or less tech rich agencies? 


✅ Use inclusive language in screener survey and participant communication


 Colorado BHA Content Standards has many resources on topics like: 
Avoiding stigmatizing words 
Choosing plain language words
Using person-first language


✅ Be transparent about what you will and won’t talk about

Note: this may prime the conversation; decide if appropriate based on type and scope of research
Include in participant communications: 
What will we talk about? First, I’ll ask you about your insurance, then about your most recent experience searching for behavioral healthcare online. Then, we will look at a care directory together on your screen, so that I can hear your feedback. I won't be asking you about your medical history or any diagnoses you may have, but you can share what you’d like to. You are the expert in your own life experiences, so our main goal will be listening to and learning from you.


 ✅ Be transparent about what to expect, logistics-wise
Include in participant communications: 
Session information: When joining the session using Google Meet, please be prepared to turn on your camera. I will ask you to share your screen. Please be prepared to read materials and respond to them as part of the conversation.


✅ Ask about access or safety needs


Include in participant communications: 
Questions or Requests? Let us know if you have any questions, requests, or changes to the planned topics. We want to give you the best chance of feeling comfortable and safe during our conversation. 


✅ Encourage participant to choose a safe space for the interview


Include in participant communications: 
 What’s the plan? We’ll talk for an hour, and I will lead the discussion - no preparation ahead of time on your part will be necessary. It will feel friendly and supportive. Please choose a space and time where you feel safe, and you’re more likely to be able to talk freely. 





Interview
(Source: Helping survivors to feel safe during UX research)

Recommendations
Notes and/or Example(s)
✅ Build in check-points 


Build in 2–3 consent checkpoints into the discussion guide. 
This meant that a few times during the session, we stopped to see how the participant was feeling, and gave them the chance to take a break, grab a glass of water, switch topics, or stop completely. 
More often than not, this checkpoint gave me a chance to recap what I’d learned so far, and refocus the conversation with good energy.


✅ Give participants right to choose not to answer questions 
Consider saying to the participant: 
“These topics can be quite personal, so at any point as we talk you can pause, take a break, or skip a question if you would like (you don’t have to give a reason).”


✅ Try to disrupt power dynamic so participants lead with honesty 
Consider saying to the participant: 
“Share your honest feedback and opinions. Nothing you say can hurt my feelings (I didn’t build these websites!). I just want to hear your thoughts so the team working on these can make improvements.”


✅ Establish that participant is the expert 
Consider saying to the participant: 
“You are the expert in your lived experience, so our main goal will be listening to and learning from you. It doesn’t matter if you don’t think it is “typical” or “normal” - in fact, we particularly want to understand your unique perspectives.”


✅ If the interview is getting too personal or off-topic, try a compassionate re-direct. 
Consider saying to the participant: 
“You know, I feel that you and I could talk for hours about this! What you’ve shared about X and Y is so interesting/insightful. I’m learning a lot from you. Would it be OK if I asked you about a few other things in the time we have left?”

“I can sense how difficult this experience was for you, I’m so sorry you went through this. It sounds so hard.”


✅ End the interview with transparency around compensation (payment) and/or next steps in process 






Interview follow-up
(Source: Helping survivors to feel safe during UX research; TaDa team notes)

Recommendations
Notes / Example(s)
✅ Follow up with participants who have shared any distress, and check in with how they’re doing. 



Do this the day after, to give them a chance to reflect, and I’ll always take the opportunity to mention how much you learned and how well I felt the interview went.
✅ Debrief the interview with team members who were in the session.




🟡 If needed / sensitive content in interviews: Schedule weekly check-in sessions with research, design, amd PM collaborators to check-in about vicarious trauma and to offer each other care.  


Key resource: Why Self-Care Matters in UX Research

Consider reading Trauma Stewardship: An Everyday Guide to Caring for Self While Caring for Others
🟡 If needed: Provide resources if an interview subject is needing care/emergency care.
