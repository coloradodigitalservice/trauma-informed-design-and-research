# Trauma-Informed Research and Design

_Last updated Apr 17, 2025_  
**Written by Alex Orlov (<alexandra.orlov@state.co.us>), Bianca Frazer, and Abigail Fisher**  

> **Note**: This document was originally created by researchers and designers at Colorado‚Äôs Behavioral Health Administration (BHA). However, the information and resources can be applicable to anyone looking to practice trauma-informed research and design. The content has been lightly edited to suit a wider audience. ‚Äî Jane Lien  

## Purpose of this doc

In this document, we aim to synthesize resources and best practices in order to take care of our participants and ourselves during research and co-design activities.

## Invitation

### To researchers and designers:
Use this guide to approach research with care for participants and for ourselves. Add comments, content, or resources. This is a living document meant to be improved upon.

### To vendor partners:
Vendors are welcome to browse this guide and the linked resources to help prepare for any research that may touch on challenging topics. Know that this guide is a living document ‚Äî incomplete, always a work in progress, and open to input and feedback.

## Overview of Concepts

### What is a trauma-informed approach to user research?

Trauma-informed research:

- **Realizes** the widespread impact of trauma  
- **Recognizes** and acknowledges the signs and symptoms of trauma in participants, researchers, and others involved with the research process  
- **Integrates** knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices  
- **Seeks** to actively resist retraumatization  
> *(Adapted from SAMHSA)*

### What causes trauma?

Trauma results from events or circumstances that are perceived as physically or emotionally harmful. These may include:

- Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse  
- Family health issues or substance use  
- Domestic violence or assault  
- Chronic poverty, racism, or discrimination  
- Community violence, war, or terrorism  
- Natural disasters

### SAMHSA‚Äôs Foundation of a Trauma-Informed Approach

> ‚ÄúReally, the key is understanding the trauma-informed principles because then you can think of how to apply them in your particular situation.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Melissa Eggleston

**Six Key Principles:**

1. Safety  
2. Trustworthiness and Transparency  
3. Peer Support  
4. Collaboration and Mutuality  
5. Empowerment, Voice and Choice  
6. Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues

### Applying SAMHSA‚Äôs Principles

| **SAMHSA Principle** | **Caring for Participants** | **Caring for Researchers** |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Safety** | Will participants feel safe? Are support practices in place? | Are researchers supported in processing difficult topics? |
| **Trustworthiness & Transparency** | Is info clearly communicated? Can we simplify consent? | Are timelines and deliverables clear? |
| **Collaboration & Mutuality** | Are survivors supported in co-design? Are insights compensated? | Are we challenging expert bias? |
| **Empowerment, Voice & Choice** | Do participants control what they disclose? | Are researchers empowered? |
| **Cultural, Historical & Gender Issues** | Are we including diverse identities and inclusive language? | Are we reflecting on biases? |
| **Peer Support** | n/a | Do researchers feel supported by peers/team? |

### Recruitment and Participant Communication

- ‚úÖ **Consider who is or isn‚Äôt represented**  
  _E.g., geographic or resource-based diversity_

- ‚úÖ **Use inclusive language**  
  _Refer to Colorado BHA Content Standards_

- ‚úÖ **Be transparent about research topics**  
  _List what will and won‚Äôt be discussed_

- ‚úÖ **Clarify logistics**  
  _Share session expectations and tools used_

- ‚úÖ **Ask about access or safety needs**  
  _Invite requests to support participant comfort_

- ‚úÖ **Encourage safe spaces**  
  _Let participants choose interview time/location_

## Interview

_(Source: ‚ÄúHelping survivors to feel safe during UX research‚Äù)_

- ‚úÖ **Build in check-points**  
  _Pause to assess comfort and regroup_

- ‚úÖ **Give choice to skip questions**  
  _"You can pause or skip anything at any time."_

- ‚úÖ **Disrupt power dynamics**  
  _"Your honest feedback can‚Äôt hurt my feelings!"_

- ‚úÖ **Center participant expertise**  
  _"You're the expert in your experience."_

- ‚úÖ **Redirect if needed, compassionately**  
  _"Can we talk about a few other things before we wrap up?"_

- ‚úÖ **Clarify payment/next steps at end**

## Interview Follow-Up

_(Sources: ‚ÄúHelping survivors to feel safe during UX research‚Äù; TaDa team notes)_

- ‚úÖ **Check in with distressed participants**  
  _Follow up the next day, reflect, show appreciation_

- ‚úÖ **Debrief with team members**  
  _Discuss emotional load and observations_

- üü° **Schedule regular check-ins**  
  _For teams processing vicarious trauma_

- üü° **Provide care/emergency resources as needed**
